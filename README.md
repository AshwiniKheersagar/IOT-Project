<center><h1></h1>**A Smart Ventilation Solution for Comfortable Indoor Environment**</h1></center>

<h4>** PROBLEM STATEMENT**</h4>
• Traditional exhaust systems often operate on fixed schedules or manual controls, leading to energy
wastage and inefficient ventilation.
• Moreover, in environments where temperature fluctuations are significant, maintaining a
comfortable atmosphere becomes challenging.
• Our project addresses these issues by providing an automated solution that adapts to changing
temperature conditions, ensuring optimal ventilation while minimizing energy consumption
